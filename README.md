# Supermarket Restock Optimization

## 📌 Overview
Supermarket Restock Optimization is a web-based project that optimizes supermarket inventory restocking using three algorithms:
- **Knapsack Algorithm** (for maximizing inventory within constraints)
- **Greedy Algorithm** (for quick decision-making)
- **Predictive Machine Learning** (basic model for forecasting demand)

The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🛠️ Features
- 📊 **Optimized restocking** using the Knapsack and Greedy algorithms.
- 🔮 **Simple predictive model** to forecast demand trends.
- 🎨 **User-friendly UI** with interactive elements.
- ⚡ **Fast and efficient** decision-making for inventory management.

## 📌 How It Works
### 1️⃣ Knapsack Algorithm
- Allocates items efficiently while maximizing stock value within constraints.

### 2️⃣ Greedy Algorithm
- Provides a quick, suboptimal restock strategy for efficiency.

### 3️⃣ Predictive Machine Learning
- Uses past data (preloaded sample dataset) to forecast demand for items.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Improve ML model accuracy using real-time sales data.
- Implement backend for data storage.
- Add a more advanced UI with charts.
